## The Problem

So COVID came along and made Remote work possible. Yay!!!.

Now we can work from the comfort of our homes,in pyjamas,sipping coffee from that large Mug we got for special moments like these.
<br />

I don't know about you, but to me, working like this is a dream come true.
<br />
<br />
But as the saying goes,
> When you pray for the rain, you've got to deal with the mud too

Working from home ain't all sunshine and Rainbows.
<br />

Most of us are parents, and for some sweet reason, our kids always decide to show how much they love us, during zoom meetings or when we want to put in some work.
<br />
<br />
They're either banging on the closed door or creating some noise with their toys, because there's nobody to sit and put them to order.
<br />
<br />
There has to be a solution to this ðŸ¤”.

Yeahhhh... Get a nanny.

But then,other issues come in.
<br />

- Firstly, where or how do I get this nanny ?

- Supposing I meet them ,am I comfortable leaving my kids with somebody I just met ?

- How do I evaluate them to know if they are a good fit for my kids ?

- How can I speak to other parents that have worked with them in the past ?
  <br />
  And a ton of other concerns.

BUT!!!!!
<br />

What if there's an online service, just for stuff like this ?
- Where you can meet people willing to carryout nanny duties?
- You can post job offers.
- See Nanny ratings based on previous jobs they've completed.
- Connect with other parents.
- Book a nanny
- etc

<br />
That's the main purpose of this Project.

To serve as a proof of concept
incase you have plans to build something similar in the near future or you just intend on
grabbing the concept of event driven architectures.
